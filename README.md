# nobel-sim

This repo holds the Stata code that simulates an "equal-opportunity" world where only additive, heritable ability drives scientific success; we use the draws to reproduce the parent-income distribution of top scientists under various genetic scenarios.

The outputs feed Table 3 and Figure 4 of **Novosad, Asher, Farquharson, and Iljazi (2025)**. See Sections 4.2 and Appendix B.5 of the paper for additional context: [*Access to Opportunity in the Sciences: Evidence from the Nobel Laureates*](https://paulnovosad.com/pdf/nobel-prizes.pdf)
